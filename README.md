# MindLabyrinth - Group Project at RidgeHacks 2016
A simple-to-use online web application which prompts 
your responses and changes its questions according to
what you likely feel the need to talk about the most. 

It is aimed at helping people facing peer-to-peer 
conflict who are unsure as to what to do next. 
Through guiding you through a process of 
calm thinking on your state of affairs, 
it ensures you feel that you have complete 
understanding on your own self-actualization.

Instead of directly telling you what to do, 
the Mind Labyrinth helps you to reflect on
your actions and the consequences. 

This way, you can make the most rational 
decisions based on your situation and your
own perception of what would most likely happen next.
